Sex linked regions
each scaffold coverign one of know regions manually observed. using rasolark
flanks moving into other region rrimmed. Dublecheck with skylark, then rasolark with synteny to zebra
if Z flanking unknoqn scaffold, then assumed all is Z if pattern correct (rasolark parus only)
For PAR, there is some difference between species in 000137.1. I set the limits so than Raso has a gene not in sex linkage, and skylark has it sex linked instead.
